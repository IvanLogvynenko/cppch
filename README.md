C Plus Plus Course Helper

Just find typing a lot of commands boring...

# Run Env

Terminal in any Unix like system (Linux, Mac Os, WSL)

# Setup

Well, clone the repo. then cd in the repo. then run the only .sh file you see here. Follow the instructions...
All requested data will be (hopefully) stored in the cloned repo in .conf

So don't worry about your data being saved, it is just a file on YOUR pc.

After configuration is done, restart the terminal or load rc file again

# Configuration

If you want to change something just delete .conf folder(not .config) and then it will be as freshly the cloned one
(after you remove env vars end PATH modification done in the shell rc file during first start)

# Licence

It is under GPL, the code is open source and free to use and modify
